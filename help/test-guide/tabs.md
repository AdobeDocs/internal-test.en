# Tabs test

## Page tabs

A tab is a clickable area at the top of a section that shows different content. When a tab is clicked, the tab's contents are shown, and the contents of other tabs is hidden. You can add multiple sets of tabs within a page. Note that users cannot use in-page search (Ctrl+F/Cmd+F) to locate content within tabs that are not displayed.
