## Journeys exampl


Use [!DNL Journey Optimizer] to build real-time orchestration use cases using contextual data stored in events or data sources. You can design multistep advanced scenarios with following capabilities:

* Send real-time **unitary delivery** triggered when an event is received, or **in batch** using Adobe Experience Platform audiences.

* Leverage **contextual data** from events, information from Adobe Experience Platform, or data from third-party API services.

* Use the **built-in actions** to send messages designed in [!DNL Journey Optimizer] or create **custom actions** if you're using a third-party system to send your messages.

* With the **journey designer**, build your multistep use cases: easily drag and drop an entry event or a read audience activity, add conditions and send personalized messages.

The Journey Optimizer journey designer provides everything marketers and journey practitioners need to orchestrate multi-step 1:1 journeys across channels. This includes an intuitive drag-and-drop canvas to orchestrate each step of the journey, define the target audience, and include the messages, offers, and content across channels that target audience members will see based on behavior, contextual data, and business events.

Learn how to create and design your first journey in [this page](https://www.adobe.com).

## Use cases{#uc-journey}

From within the journey designer, marketers can send real-time triggered 1:1 messages through any channel when an event occurs. For example, when a customer subscribes to a service, it can [trigger a welcome email](https://www.adobe.com), encouraging them to log into the app for the first time and set their preferences. Actions like completing the purchase, opening the email, and logging into the app can be used to advance new customers through their journeys.

The [journey designer](https://www.adobe.com) provides [built-in channel actions](https://www.adobe.com) that support outbound messages, such as emails, push notifications, and SMS/MMS, as well as inbound channels, including mobile apps, websites, and code-based experiences built directly within Journey Optimizer. You can also use third-party systems to send messages — whether via email, text, or other channels — Journey Optimizer includes [custom actions](https://www.adobe.com) to allow these systems to be integrated into journeys directly from the journey designer.

Learn how to build journeys in the following end-to-end use cases:

* [Send multi-channel messages](https://www.adobe.com)
* [Send a message using Campaign v7/v8](https://www.adobe.com)
* [Send a message to subscribers](https://www.adobe.com)
* [Pass collections dynamically using custom actions](https://www.adobe.com)
* [Limit throughput with External Data Sources and Custom Actions](https://www.adobe.com)
